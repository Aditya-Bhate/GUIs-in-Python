# GUI's-in-Python 💥

### What are widgets ?
Widgets are eventful python objects that have a representation in the browser, often as a control like a slider, textbox, etc.

### What can they be used for ?
▪ You can use widgets to build interactive GUIs for your notebooks.<br>
▪ You can also use widgets to synchronize stateful and stateless information between Python and JavaScript.

◾ *Widget Basics*  <br>
◾ *Widget Events*<br>
◾ *Widget Lists*<br>
◾ *Widget Styling*<br>
◾ *Interactive functionality with Python GUI !*<br>

✌ In Custom Widget, we explored The Lorenz System of Differential Equations using Python libraries such as IPython, NumPy, Matplotlib and SciPy 😀.

#
### How to import libraries for custom widget :
```python
%matplotlib inline
